# Google Developer Student Club Workshop
## UI and UX Design with React and Tailwind CSS

Welcome to the Google Developer Student Club (DSC) workshop on UI and UX Design with React and Tailwind CSS. In this workshop, we will explore the fundamentals of UI and UX design principles, apply them to a sample React web application with poor design, and collaboratively improve its design using Tailwind CSS.

### Workshop Overview

This workshop is designed to help you gain a better understanding of user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design principles and how they can be applied to web applications. The main components of the workshop include:

1. **Introduction to UI/UX Design:**
   - Understanding the importance of UI and UX in web development.
   - Exploring key design principles and heuristics.

2. **Design Heuristics and Principles:**
   - Focusing on the ten usability heuristics by Jakob Nielsen.
   - Interactive slides that guide you through practical examples.

3. **Tools and Resources:**
   - Introducing design tools and resources such as Coolors for color palettes and font generators for typography.

4. **Practical Session:**
   - Providing a React web application with poor UI/UX design.
   - Collaboratively improving the design using Tailwind CSS and UI/UX principles.

## Important Note

The website provided in this project intentionally has poor UI and UX design. This is done to create a learning experience where participants in the workshop will work collaboratively to improve the design using the principles and tools introduced in the workshop. Feel free to explore the existing design and make changes to enhance it during the workshop.
